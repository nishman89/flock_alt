# Flock 🐦

**Make genuine friends through shared Flocks.**

A mobile-first web app that connects you with local people who share your interests. Join a Flock  -  a football watch party, a food tour, a board game night, a hike  -  show up, and meet people who are actually like you.

> "Birds of a feather Flock together." That's not just a saying  -  it's the whole idea.

## What's a Flock?

A **Flock** is what we call every event on the app. Each Flock has a fixed number of spots, a time, a place, and a shared vibe. You join a Flock, show up, and meet your people. When you join, the going count increases and the spots decrease in real time  -  so you always know exactly how many spaces are left.

## Getting a Live URL

### Option 1  -  GitHub Pages (free)

1. Create a free account at **[github.com](https://github.com)**
2. Create a new repository called `flock` (set to **Public**)
3. Upload all the files from this folder
4. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → select `main` branch → Save**
5. Your URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/flock`

### Option 2  -  Netlify (free, even easier)

1. Go to **[netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign up free
2. Drag and drop the entire `flock` folder onto the deploy area
3. Instantly live at something like `https://flock-abc123.netlify.app`

> **Note:** Geolocation ("Use my location") requires HTTPS to work on mobile. Both GitHub Pages and Netlify provide this automatically.

## Installing as an iPhone App (PWA)

Once you have a live HTTPS URL, open it in **Safari on iPhone**:

1. Tap the **Share** button (box with arrow at the bottom of the screen)
2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Tap **"Add"** in the top right

Flock now lives on your home screen and opens full screen with no browser chrome  -  exactly like a native app. Works offline once cached.

## Test Automation Guide

See `explanation-of-code.md` for the full testability assessment and ID reference.

### Quick start — key selectors

| Element | Selector |
|---------|----------|
| Login username | `#login-username` |
| Login password | `#login-password` |
| Login submit | `#login-submit-btn` |
| Signup first name | `#signup-firstname` |
| Signup username | `#signup-username` |
| Signup submit | `#signup-submit-btn` |
| Flock cards (home) | `[id^="event-card-"]` |
| Join button | `#join-event-btn` |
| Leave button | `#leave-event-btn` |
| Waitlist button | `#waitlist-btn` |
| Share button | `#share-btn` |
| Search input | `#search-input` |
| City filter | `#city-filter` |
| Sort filter | `#sort-filter` |
| Location button | `#location-btn` |
| Bottom nav items | `.nav-item[data-page="home"]` etc. |
| Sidebar nav items | `#sidebar-nav-home` etc. |

### Known limitations for automation
- localStorage only - no network requests to stub
- Geolocation requires browser permission grant (mock in test config)
- Leaflet map loads tiles from OpenStreetMap CDN (can be mocked or ignored)
- Chat popup is UI-only (no state to assert beyond visibility)
