# Flock 🐦

**Make genuine friends through shared Flocks and Roosts.**

A mobile-first web app that connects you with local people who share your interests. Join a **Flock** (a group), show up to a **Roost** (a specific gathering), and make real friends through repeated shared experiences.

> "Birds of a feather Flock together." That's not just a saying - it's the whole idea.

## The Language

| Term | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| **Flock** | A group of like-minded people, e.g. "Arsenal Supporters Club London" or "Edinburgh Whisky Society" |
| **Roost** | A specific gathering organised by a Flock - a time, a place, and a plan |

You join a **Flock** (the community). You attend a **Roost** (the event). You see the same faces across multiple Roosts and make genuine friends.
